# Solo Tank (Tentative (Title)

A top-down tank action game to be played with the mouse and keyboard. Currently a work in progress.

### Platform and Development Environment

This game is being developed for the TIC-80 fantasy computer and coded in Lua. The complete, executable source code is on the cartridge file (*soloTank.tic*) and requires a TIC-80 installation to run. The source has been broken down into separate LUA files for organization and convenience.

Note, the coding style is intentionally very condensed to conserve space on the memory bank (64kb limit for source code).

### Concept

The player moves the tank in 8 directions with the W-A-S-D keys, and aims, fires, or toggles ammo with the mouse. The player can dismount the tank to grab items, but will become more vulnerable and lose the ability to fire.

The current goal is for the game to have four levels across 4 memory banks, 2 banks for boss fights, and the remaining 2 banks for menus and visual gimmicks, like displaying a spinning 3D wireframe model of the enemies between levels. There should be a unique music track for each level, as well as the menu, game over, and victory screens.

A few screenshots of the game in development can be seen below.
